# Reason

Ant Design is an incredible tool for building web products fast. I mean - just mindblowingly good! Then there is Ant Design Pro which is... not as easy to start with.

Therefore I created Antmin. It provides a simple API in order to get started with your admin panel quickly.

# Packages

-   **@antmin/admin** - The main react library including the full power of antmin.
-   **@antmin/ui** - All the Antmin components which could be imported separately.
-   **@antmin/scaffold** - Creates a react boilerplate project using `antmin` in order to quickly get started.
-   **@antmin/cli** - Currently more or less a wrapper around `@antmin/cli` but will probably include more tools in the future.

# TODO

-   Determine documentation tool

    -   https://typegen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ ?
    -   https://typedoc.org/guides/installation/ ?
    -   https://github.com/microsoft/tsdoc ?
-   Implement Github actions
-   Implement building scripts (using tsc or webpack?)
